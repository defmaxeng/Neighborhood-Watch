# Neighborhood-Watch
The Neighborhood-Watch website will broadcast the locations of suspicious events or actual crimes occuring near a user through peer responses given to the server, as well as give general tips and advice for staying safe. Users will be required to determine the type of event that is occuring, write a brief description, as well as provide a general address of the event.
